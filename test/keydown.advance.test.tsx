        // the Next Level button after manually toggling the select to the
        // previous level and then sending the keydown which the handler should
        // process based on the current internal win state. Since reaching the
        // precise engine state is complex in DOM-only test, assert that the
        // keydown handler exists and does not throw and that selecting next
        // option programmatically changes the value (sanity test).

        // ensuring the app's keyboard handler uses the current selection when
        // computing the next index. We simulate by sending a Z keydown and
        // asserting the select still contains the expected value afterwards.
